1.Write code to generate and catch an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
2.Create your own exception class using the extends keyword. Write a constructor for this class that takes a String argument and stores it inside the object with a String reference. 
Write a method that prints out the stored String. Create a try-catch clause to exercise your new exception
3.Create a three-level hierarchy of exceptions. Now create a base-class A with a method that throws an exception at the base of your hierarchy. 
Inherit B from A and override the method so it throws an exception at level two of your hierarchy. Repeat by inheriting class C from B. 
In main( ), create a C and upcast it to A, then call the method
4.Create three new types of exceptions. Write a class with a method that throws all three. 
In main( ), call the method but only use a single catch clause that will catch all three types of exceptions
5.Modify Exercise 4 by adding a finally clause. Verify that your finally clause is executed, even if a NullPointerException is thrown. 
6.Write code to generate and catch a runtime exception
