constructor
1. Modify the Student class presented as follows. Each
student object should also contain the scores for three tests. Provide
a constructor that sets all instance values based on parameter values.
Overload the constructor such that each test score is assumed to be
initially zero. Provide a method called setTestScore that accepts
two parameters: the test number (1 through 3) and the score. Also
provide a method called getTestScore that accepts the test number
and returns the appropriate score. Provide a method called average
that computes and returns the average test score for this student.
Modify the toString method such that the test scores and average
are included in the description of the student. create a class
with main method to exercise the new Student methods.

public class Student
{
private String firstName, lastName;
private Address homeAddress, schoolAddress;
//-----------------------------------------------------------------
// Sets up this Student object with the specified initial values.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------
public Student (String first, String last, Address home,
Address school)
{
firstName = first;
lastName = last;
homeAddress = home;
schoolAddress = school;
}
//-----------------------------------------------------------------
// Returns this Student object as a string.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------
public String toString()
{
String result;
result = firstName + " " + lastName + "\n";
result += "Home Address:\n" + homeAddress + "\n";
result += "School Address:\n" + schoolAddress;
return result;
}
}


2. Design and implement a class called Course that represents a course
taken at a school. A course object should keep track of up to five
students, as represented by the modified Student class from the previous
programming project. The constructor of the Course class
should accept only the name of the course. Provide a method called
addStudent that accepts one Student parameter (the Course object
should keep track of how many valid students have been added to
the course). Provide a method called average that computes and
returns the average of all students’ test score averages. Provide a
method called roll that prints all students in the course. Create a
driver class with a main method that creates a course, adds several
students, prints a roll, and prints the overall course test average.
